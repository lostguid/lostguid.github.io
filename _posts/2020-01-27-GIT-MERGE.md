GIT is the most powerful GI(F)T given by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) to dev community. The most common commands that I use on a daily basis are clone, fetch, push, commit, **stash**. In this post I want to give my thoughts on when to use **merge** vs **rebase**, the key differences between them, pros and cons of both.

### What is merge and rebase

To integrate changes from another branch we use either ```git merge``` or ```git rebase```. While both these commands do the job, it is good to know when to use either of them for a better commit history!

Be informed that all the below examples are assumed to **not** have any merge-conflicts(no two separate branches have edits to the same line in a file)

#### Situation

Alright! We are in a situation now! Let's say there is a master branch and you are working on a feature and checked out from the master branch(```master```). Since you're a fast coder, you've already made 2 new commits(```C1```&```C2```) to your ```b1``` branch! Good going!
Now your colleague who works on the same team is working on another branch ```b2```, wrote code faster than you, made 2 commits(```C3```&```C4```) and is ready push changes to master before you!

Let's visualize the above situation below!

Okay! So your colleague is done with his feature after those 2 commits and pushed the code to master branch. The master branch is now ahead of yourbranch(```b1```) by 2 commits!

Now you found that you have to make changes in a file that's updated by your colleague when he merged his branch ```b2``` to ```master```
#### What do you do???
Yes, you would do either ```merge``` or ```rebase```. But which one and why?
