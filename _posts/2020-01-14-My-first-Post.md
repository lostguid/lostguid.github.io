**2020** is here! And my birthday too!

After attending [Codemash](https://www.codemash.org/) 2020 at Sandusky, I am greatly inspired by the technology advancement happening in the industry! I am also surprised to see many attendees very much passionate about what they work on!

I picked up few good learnings from the sessions, especially regarding GIT, Web authentication/authorization. I will try to post my learnings here as separate individual blog posts.

Hopefully, this website gives me enough motivation to learn more and post!
